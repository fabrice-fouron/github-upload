VIGENERE CIPHER
The Vigenere Cipher uses a keyword that helps vary the encryption. 
The content and the keyword or both transformed into numbers (the respective index of the letters in the alphabet). 
Make sure that if the key is shorter than the content, repeat the same sequence of numbers until they are the same length
Add the numbers from content with the ones in the key
Convert the result to their corresponding letters in the alphabet

To decrypt, use the same solution but subtract the key from the content.
